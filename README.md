This is my Week 4 Exercise 4.
For this, I used my old Week 2 Assignment 2 Jupyter Notebook as the Main Work

This Exercise includes the following questions

1. Define two variables and assign them values of 100 and 29. 
  After this, make the interpreter sum up the two numbers and multiply their result by 3. 
  Calculate the 2nd exponent of the previous number and save it to a new variable.
  Make the program print the result in the following way: The result of the calculation was:149769
  Make sure you use valid variable names and name your variables meaningfully.
  Make sure that the output of your program has indentation as shown in the above example

2. Write a program that creates a password by asking the user to input their name, age, year of birth. 
   Save all in separate variables using the right type for each of them. 
   The program should create the password in following way: takes last two digits of year of birth, 
   first 3 letters from name, and the 2ndpower of the age according to the example below
   :Name: JohnYear of birt: 1995Age: 26Password: 95Joh676
   Hint: to get the desired output in print() all variables have to be type str.

3. Write a program that asks for two numbers. If both numbers are even, the program prints "Both numbers are even." 
  If only one of the numbers is even, the program prints "One of the numbers is even.".
  Finally, if neither of the numbers is even, the program prints "Both numbers are odd".
  First number: 5Second number: 6One of the numbers is even

4. Create a program, which asks the user for a number, 
  and calculates the sum of all positive numbers from 0 to the user-given input.
  If the user gives the number 4, the program calculates the sum 0+1+2+3, if 7, the calculation is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6. 
  The program operates as bellow: Give an integer: 5The sum was: 10

5. Create a program that can be used as a guessing game. The game is played by Dealer and Player.
  Dealergenerates a random integer number between 0 and 10. 
  The player has to guess it. The program should take input from the Player as long as the
  Player inputs the same number as the Dealer’s input was.
  Player gets advice to choose greater or smaller numbers in the next choice. Finally,
  program has to also display the number of tries until the number is guessed.
  The program operates as follows:Player: 2Try a greater number.
  Player: 7Try a smaller number.Player: 5 That’s right! Number of tries: 3 
  Hint: import random and generate random numbers by using random. randint () in the desired range
